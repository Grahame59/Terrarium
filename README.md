# Terrarium
Ecosytem Simulation Project all in Pure C# with SMFL

# 7.15.24 - 6:01 pm 
- Setup the main file directory, dependencies, and general framework...

# 8.26.24 - 12:48 am
- Built a network listener into my primary project Dansby so now I can send Errors to a defined ErrorLog I have built in Dansby.... Will use ErrorLog to work on Terrarium in depth...

# 8.27.24 - 5:38 pm
- #1 Got the PerlinNoise to work and generate a 2D noise map...
- #2 Switched from SFML to OpenTK
- #3 Work on Shaders for Terrarium...

# 8.29.24 - 11:16 pm
- working on shaders, adding a camera, sorely lacking in good comprehension of overall code using a lot of help and trying to learn the code as I work through errors... 
- Having issues Loading the Terrain covered a lot of bases, very unsure of why it won't render as I was able to render simple shapes, the PerlinNoise math is correct, etc... Will probably take a break and return in next session...
